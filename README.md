## &#x2728; What is push_swap?

This project requires to sort data in a stack, using a limited set of instructions, and with the fewest possible operations. To succeed, you will sort 100 numbers with maximun 700 movements and 500 numbers in 5000.
			
## 🕹 Movements

| | |
|---|---|
|`sa`| swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.|
|`sb`|  swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.|
|`ss`| sa and sb at the same time.|
|`pa`| take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. |
|`pb`| take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. |
|`ra`| shift up all elements of stack a by 1. |
|`rb`| shift up all elements of stack b by 1. |
|`rr`| ra and rb at the same time. |
|`rra`| shift down all elements of stack a by 1. |
|`rrb`|shift down all elements of stack b by 1. |
|`rrr`|rra and rrb at the same time. |

## &#x1F4BB; Usage

`make` to compile.

`exe` to compile and run a example of unsorted numbers.

`make clean` remove .o files.

`make fclean` remove .o files and .a files and executable.

## &#x1F4D6; Examples

Execute this command in the terminal.

```bash
nums="9 8 7 6 5 4" && ./push_swap $nums 
```
Output should be:

```bash
rra
pb
rra
pb
rra
pb
sa
rra
pa
pa

```
